Agile Lesson Notes:
- Iterations = Sprints: Deliver product every time works along with customer value (transportation)
- Cone of uncertainity: At the beginning there are more uncertainity, every iteration is a chance
to communicate with customer and adjust the course. It's cheaper to make changes at the beggining.
- Epic: Large value statement
- Velocity: Story points average of the team on every sprint
- User stories listed in value order
